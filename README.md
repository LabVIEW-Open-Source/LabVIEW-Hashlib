# labview_hashlib
Secure hash and message digest algorithms writen in plain LabVIEW designed primarily for web application authentication.

LabVIEW library includes: SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-256, PBKDF2-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-256 and Base64 encoding/decoding.

## Algorithms
- SCRAM-SHA-256 - [RFC 5802] Secure authentication mechanism (client first and final messages)
- PBKDF2-SHA-256 - [RFC 2898C] Salted password-based cryptography
- HMAC-SHA-256 - [RFC 2104] Keyed hashing
- SHA-256 - [RFC 4634] 256 bit hash
- Base64 - [RFC 4648] Encode/decode

Refer to the specifications at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfcXXXX.
